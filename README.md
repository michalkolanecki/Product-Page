![cover](./img/readme-img/main-page.png)



Layout was creating with **HTML**, **CSS** and some **JavaScript**.


I used to **SCSS** to add styles for this webpage.


Product Page is static **without dynamic data** and **form submit**.


Is fully responsive from **375px** to **1600px**.


Page has some effects like for example change color when hover menu, open/close menu and change "Quantity" in first row product (increase or decrease value pressing "**-**" or "**+**" and its't go less than 1).
